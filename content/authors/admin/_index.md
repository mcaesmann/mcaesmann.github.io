Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [University of Zurich](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en.html) and holder of an [UBS Center Scholarship](https://www.ubscenter.uzh.ch/en/scholarships.html). I visited [UC Berkeley](https://econ.berkeley.edu) in Spring 2024. My research focuses on the intersection of political economics, economic history and economics of culture.

<span style="color: #1976d2;"><strong>I am on the 2025–2026 Job Market.</strong></span>

More information is available in my [CV](uploads/resume.pdf).
