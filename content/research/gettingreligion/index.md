abstract: "This paper examines how new identity markers emerge, spread, and define enduring social boundaries. I study this process in Reformation Germany (1480–1806) using 4.9 million baptismal names from 2,112 towns to trace how families expressed religious affiliation through naming choices. Naming remained nearly identical across Catholics and Protestants for decades after 1517 but diverged sharply after 1570, stabilizing into persistent polarization by 1618. Church enforcement strengthened local religious identities, while social learning and conformity spread them across space. I exploit geographic and temporal variation in the founding of Jesuit and Protestant colleges in a staggered difference-in-differences design. Counterfactual college placements adjust for expected exposure, and church visitation records provide an independent proxy for enforcement intensity. I quantify learning dynamics using spatial-lag models inspired by the DeGroot framework, showing that towns updated their naming toward locally shared beliefs and conformed to prevailing norms. Together, the results show that religious competition triggered institutional reform that reinforced group identities and diffused them through social learning, shaping long-run patterns of religious polarization, culture, and economic behavior."
